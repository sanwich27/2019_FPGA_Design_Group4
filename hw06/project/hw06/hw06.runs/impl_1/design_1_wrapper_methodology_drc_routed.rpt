2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/controller_0/inst/controller_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m1/state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/controller_0/inst/controller_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m1/state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/processor_0/inst/nstate_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
